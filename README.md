# Amazon_link_cleaner
A Chrome extension that removes every unnecessary item from an Amazon link, leaving only the essential product ID.
## How does it work
It's simple: Want to share an Amazon link but it's long and messy? Just click on the extension icon and then hit the button. You'll be redirected to a clean version of the page, and the shortened link will be copied to your clipboard.
## Installation
- Download this repo and extract the ZIP file.
- Go to chrome://extensions (or the equivalent for Edge, Brave, etc.).
- Enable "Developer mode."
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you extracted the repo.
- The extension will now appear in the extensions tab, accessible by clicking the puzzle icon in your browser.
